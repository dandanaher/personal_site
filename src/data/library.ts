      "Inspiring and humbling. A rarity to get such first-hand insight into spaceflight on a human scale. This book is linked to special memories for me. Not only is it a good read, of course, but my copy is signed by Tim himself! I watched his talk with my Dad while he was promoting the book, and by fluke we ran into him in the chip shop before the event. He's an awesome, down-to-earth guy (pun intended), and he made time for my enthusiasm even though he was likely eager to get into the venue. Recommended if you're a space nerd like myself.",
